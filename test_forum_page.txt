        Dynamic Block Stretch and Rotate Actions Not Cooperating
    </h2>
    <div itemprop='text'>
        I'm trying to create a block with simple stretch and rotation actions. I have this working almost 100%, but I'd really like to have the rotation grip stay fixed to the tip of the arrow after the base polyline is stretched. I've tried including the rotation action in the action set for the stretch, but then I end up with unexpected results when rotating the block after it's stretched. Does anyone have ideas on how I could adjust this to get the desired result?

            You can do this with a more simplistic approach. Replace the linear parameter and rotation parameter with a Polar Parameter and a Polar Stretch action. It can do both stretching and rotation in one action. Include the point/move for the attribute in the polar stretch action. The point/move action will chain with the stretch and rotation of the polar stretch.
